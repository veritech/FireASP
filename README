FIREASP

Classic ASP Implementation of the FirePHP  (http://www.firephp.org/) library
As you would expect it logs output directly to the Firebug Console

BUGS & TODO

* Doesn't handle objects
* Needs a unit test (Was done in a hurry ^_^ )
* Singleton Pattern implementation
* Proper Licensing, Consider it Donation-ware for now 

USAGE

* Include the file in your project

* And use the "FALog" command to log statements

<%
	FALog( "Hello World" )
%>
